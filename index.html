					<h2>Ongoing experiments and recycling methods research</h2>
					<p>The renewable energy is focused on the most sustainable approach possible for energy sources, essentially trying to find methods that work with nature and not against it. I believe there is a way to generate energy to be used practically from energies not easily understood or explained fully like gravity and 'quantum' anything.  <br />
					<br />
					The recycling efforts focus on waste products that can be reused for anything from making fertilizers to taking old electronics and reusing the parts for energy propagation or storage devices.  Or to build useful things to sell like furniture and tools.  By finding ways to make something from nothing may be able to help create job opportunities that not only help reduce the waste of individuals and companies, but also become an opportunity for people to re-purpose and rebuild someone else's trash into their own treasure. <br />
					
					<br />
					These are just some of the ideas and directions the company is taking today.  All in all, the hope is that the outputs and outcomes will be to benefit those most in need or to at least loosen the financial burden to them, while always working with nature. <br />
